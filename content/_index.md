title: An example site

An example site for a hugo problem. It is about block in rss.xml.

Check the [site rss](/index.xml/). Everything works fine, that's cool.

Now check the sections' rss:

- [folder-1's rss](/folder-1/index.xml);
- [folder-2's rss](/folder-2/index.xml).

Compare the results generated by hugo with different versions.
